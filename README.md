# Red Black Tree

For NSU CSE225 (Data Structures). A Red-Black Tree implemented in C++

Has basic insert/delete and printing functions. Credits to Cormen's Algorithms Book for helping us figure out literally every part of this that makes it a Red-Black Tree specifically. This also has an accompanying powerpoint presentation to explain how it works.
